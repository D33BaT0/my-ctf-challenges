# Spad3kapig

## Description

r3girl finds herself facing a familiar challenge in a shadowy part of the Crypto Block, one with a notorious history. A previous trial, thought conquered, has returned with a sharp twist, demanding even greater speed and precision. The digital gauntlet has been thrown down once more, but this time, the window of opportunity is razor-thin â€“ a mere 10 seconds to decipher the hand and claim victory in this Spad3kapig rematch. Only a seasoned SpadesAce has a chance to succeed under such intense pressure.

Note: The solution provided here works for both this challenge and the original challenge.

## Solution

### Overview

Of course, before starting cryptographic analysis, you need to analyze the logic in the binary file. You might want to find a reverse engineering expert to help you examine it. The following mainly describes how the cryptographic analysis part is conducted.

In each connection to the server, the `team_seed` changes, making brute force approaches infeasible. Additionally, you need to obtain the `team_seed` within 10 seconds.

In the challenge, you can get multiple results of `rng.next()` with `team_seed,random_device()`, allowing you to collect sufficient information related to `team_seed`. Below is a general description of how to attack this challenge using cryptanalysis methods.

Note: *This challenge had an unintended solution, which was very frustrating for me. It was solved by using brute-force with optimizations, without needing the intended method for solving a Hidden Number Problem (HNP) with a three-layer modulus.*

### First. recover the rng.next() from deck. 

Upon analyzing the deck's shuffle algorithm, we can recover `[rng.next() % (i+1) for i in range(52,0,-1)]`.

However, for this challenge, we only need information about the last card. Since the server output `seed` is related to the current state, we can determine the specific value of `rng.next()%52` for each state change by inputting incorrect cards and observing the correct card sequence.

### Second. recover the `team_seed` then get flag.
The relevant random number generation uses $a=team_{seed} \oplus 0x77777777, c=2025$, and the `next()` function outputs $new\_state = a\cdot old\_state + c \pmod{m}$.

In each round, the output $seed$ is the current $state$. We know the specific values where $(a \cdot seed_i + c \pmod{m}) \pmod{52} = r_i$, which can be expressed as:

$$
a\cdot seed_i + c \equiv r_i + k_i \cdot 52\pmod{m}
$$

However, since this operates under C++ language constraints, overflow occurs. This is equivalent to:

$$
a\cdot seed_i +c \pmod{2^{32}}\pmod{m}\pmod{52} = r_i\\
a\cdot seed_i + c \equiv r_i+k_i\cdot 52 + t_i\cdot m \pmod{2^{32}}
$$

Where $t_i \in \{0,1\}$ due to the modulo $2^{32}$ operation, and $k_i$ values are relatively small. Since $\gcd(52,2^{32}) = 4$, we need to consider $r_i\pmod{13}$. By using the Hidden Number Problem (HNP) approach, we can successfully recover the value of $a$, which allows us to determine the `team_seed` generated in the current environment. 

Once we've recovered the entire RNG state, we simply need to perform one more LCG deck operation to get the flag.

## Summary

Perhaps we spent 48 hours guessing during DEFCON CTF 2025 Quals, but in the end, we still found cryptographic analysis points that could be exploited.
